## Large-Scale-Vector-DB

- Designed and implemented a scalable vector database system for dense passage retrieval using the MS-MARCO v2 dataset (8.84M passages), addressing challenges in retrieval accuracy, real-time updates, and scalability. 

- Leveraged advanced technologies such as Apache Spark for distributed data processing, Sentence-BERT for embedding generation, HNSW for high-recall real-time indexing, and DiskANN for large-scale disk-based retrieval, with AWS S3 for scalable data storage. 

- Benchmarked the system using TREC 2022 standards and the NDCG metric, achieving competitive accuracy and latency. This project demonstrated the potential of vector databases in modern applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and laid the groundwork for future enhancements, including advanced indexing algorithms and transfer learning for broader adaptability.
